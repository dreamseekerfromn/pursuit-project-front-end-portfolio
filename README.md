# pursuit-project-front-end-portfolio

## Introduction
Since im really lazy, I personally do not want to use to many APIs, and want to put "SIMPLE" and "BASIC" functionality for this project.

## How To Use?
It is really simple. Choose monster's name ,its rank, weapon that you used during that trial, typing the number of trial, and some extra stuff you want to write down.

Then the page will generate a list for that record.

But any negative numbers, zero, floats, and any character beside digit will be filtered out.
For the monster's rank, the webpage will filter out the incorrect rank of the monster you choose.

Clicking a list will show details that the user inputted w/ the form, and hovering to the icon inside the detail page will show weaknesses of the monster.

Bottom of page will show a random monster's info.

## Bug
Some monster does not have info page. (especially monsters from the DLC)
Actually it is API problem, so currently I cannot fix that issue.

Close button on the help page does not work correctly.

## Plan for Update?
This one is just basic skeleton design for the project, so it has only some basic functions.
And the API does not have some monsters' info, so I have to find another API or need to create new one for this project.
